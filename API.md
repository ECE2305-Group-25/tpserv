## Basics

There are four basic HTTP request methods, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.  To
maintain simplicity, this interface only deals with the first type, the
humble GET request.

A get request is formatted like such

```
GET https://web.site/api/endpoint?param1=value1&param2=value2
```

## Responses

All API calls generate responses in the JSON format. They are formatted like
this:

```
{
    "endpoint": "/api/status",
    "request_type": "GET",
    "success": true,
    "reason": "",
    "system_status": "everything_on_fire"
}
```

In addition to any endpoint-specific information, all requests will contain the
following four fields:

### `endpoint`

The `endpoint` parameter contains the path the initiating request was made to.
If the user makes a request to `web.site/api/foo` this parameter will contain
the string `/api/foo`.

*design note: This could probably be eliminated, I would assume the user knows
what endpoint they're calling.  I think bryce defined it originally, maybe he
knows more about it.*

### `request_type`

The `request_type` parameter contains the requesting method used.

*design note: Like the previous field, I'm not sure this is strictly necessary,
I'd like some input from bryce on it.*

### `success` and `reason`

The `success` parameter returns `true` if the request was completed
successfully, and `false` if an error occurred.  If the request was a success,
the `reason` parameter will be empty, but if the request fails this parameter
will contain a human-readable message explaining what went wrong.

## Authentication

Where authentication is required, it will be handled by a GET parameter called
`auth`, containing a **TO BE DETERMINED** authentication string.  A sample
authenticated request is as follows:

```
GET https://web.site/api/secure_endpoint?auth=132435&foo=bar
```

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are defined

### `/api/status`

Authentication Required: No

The `status` endpoint returns the current status of the system, including the
number of rolls of toilet paper remaining, and weather or not the dispenser
hardware is currently connected to the control server.

Sample Request:
```
GET https://web.site/api/status
```

Sample Response:
```
{
    "endpoint": "/api/status",
    "request_type": "GET",
    "success": true,
    "reason": "",
    "rolls_remaining": 4,
    "dispenser_connected": true
}
```

### `/api/dispense`

Authentication Required: Yes

The `dispense` endpoint surprisingly instructs the toilet paper dispenser to
release a roll.  This endpoint requires an authentication token, which will be
provided to the user via the built in displan in the unit.

Sample Request:
```
GET https://web.site/api/dispense?auth=12345
```

Sample Success Response:
```
{
    "endpoint": "/api/dispense",
    "request_type": "GET",
    "success": true,
    "reason": ""
}
```

Sample Failure Response:
```
{
    "endpoint": "/api/dispense",
    "request_type": "GET",
    "success": false,
    "reason": "Invalid authentication token"
}
```

### `/api/openlid`

Authentication Required: Yes

The `openlid` endpoint is used for unlocking the refill hatch of the unit.
Because opening the lid of the unit will grant the user unrestricted access to a
large number of toilet paper roles, this endpoint requires a special master auth
token.

Sample Request:
```
GET https://web.site/api/openlid?auth=master_auth_token
```

Sample Success Response:
```
{
    "endpoint": "/api/openlid",
    "request_type": "GET",
    "success": true,
    "reason": ""
}
```

Sample Failulre Response:
```
{
    "endpoint": "/api/openlid",
    "request_type": "GET",
    "success": false,
    "reason": "Invalid master authentication token"
}
```
